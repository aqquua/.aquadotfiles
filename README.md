# .dotfiles
Dotfiles are like config files for your system or program. You can find out if a file is a dotfile or not by seeing if they start with a . (ex. .bashrc, .zshrc) 

## Overview

These are **MY** config files, for **MY** use case. Just **dont be dumb.**  

## Dependency
This is supposed to use with ```GNU Stow```

Other programs, like XMonad have their own dependencies (not in the repo rn lol). Check out the config files for those dependencies like fonts or startup programs before you drag and drop. Stow is just the main way this is structured
